# Cozy Cup Cafe

## Project Description
A cozy cafe is a snug, welcoming spot designed for relaxation. With soft lighting, comfy seating, and a relaxed vibe, itâ€™s the ideal place to enjoy the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee or tea. The menu usually offers delicious pastries, sandwiches, and desserts, making it a great place to unwind, read, or catch up with friends.
